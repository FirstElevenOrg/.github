*"Connecting People, Bridging the Gap, Weaving Technology into the Fabric of Africa's Future"*

At FirstEleven Inc., we are a company focused on addressing the inefficiencies that exist not only in Africa but across the world. We recognize that Africa is lagging behind in socio-economic and technological development, with visible performance issues in various industries. We are committed to changing this narrative and creating a more efficient and effective society for all Africans.

By investing in our people and providing them with the necessary tools and resources, we believe we can unlock their full potential and drive sustainable growth across the continent.

Our expertise in technology and business strategy positions us well to make a significant impact on the continent's development. Let us work together to build a better Africa for generations to come.

## Letter from our Founder

As the founder of FirstEleven, I strongly believe that technology is a powerful tool that can transform our world. However, it is up to us as humans to ensure that technology is used for the greater good. Technology is not going to improve itself; it requires constant improvement and innovation from us. We must be responsible and ethical in our use of technology, and we must work towards creating a sustainable and self-sufficient infrastructure.

By harnessing the power of technology, we can automate repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on more creative and challenging work. This, in turn, frees up our time to enjoy the fruits of this world, travel and explore new places, and discover the wonders of the universe. We must continue to come up with innovative ways to explore beneath the surfaces of this world and beyond.

Our ultimate goal should be to become a multi-planetary species, and technology will play a crucial role in achieving this. However, we must also be mindful of our impact on the planet and ensure that our exploration and innovation are sustainable and do not harm the environment.

At FirstEleven, we are committed to creating a world where technology is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, allowing us to focus on what truly matters. We believe in building a better future for all, one that is built on the principles of collaboration, innovation, and progress. By using technology as a force for good, we can make a positive impact on humanity and ensure a brighter future for generations to come.- Leo Moko

## What is more important ?

As Africans, we possess unique abilities and intelligence, yet our current actions risk making life harder for future generations. It is essential that we take action to build our own future and make things easier for ourselves. We cannot allow the mistakes of past generations to continue to ruin our continent and harm our people. If we do not act now, our children will be forced to live in the same conditions we currently face, both personally and professionally. It is time to break the cycle and create a better future for ourselves and those who come after us. Let us be the change we want to see in the world. - Leo Moko
